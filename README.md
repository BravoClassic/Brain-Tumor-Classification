# Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

## Description

This project aims to classify brain tumors into four categories (glioma, meningioma, no tumor, and pituitary) using deep learning techniques. It utilizes two different models: a transfer learning model using Xception and a custom-built CNN model. The project also includes a Streamlit web application for interactive tumor classification and explanation generation using saliency maps and large language models (LLMs).

## Dataset

The project uses the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle, which can be downloaded using the following command:

## Models

Two models are implemented in this project:

1.  **Transfer Learning Model (Xception):** This model leverages the pre-trained Xception model and fine-tunes it for brain tumor classification. It utilizes the ImageNet weights and includes a max pooling layer.
2.  **Custom CNN Model:** This is a smaller, custom-built CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers. It includes dropout for regularization and a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

## Usage

1.  **Colab Notebook:** The provided Colab notebook contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. You can run the notebook to train and evaluate the models.
2.  **Streamlit Web App:** The `app.py` file contains the code for the Streamlit web application. You can run the app using the command `streamlit run app.py`. The app allows you to upload an MRI image, select a model, and get the classification results along with a saliency map and explanation generated by an LLM.

## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries:

*   Python 3.7+
*   TensorFlow 2.x
*   Keras
*   Streamlit
*   pyngrok
*   python-dotenv
*   openai

You can install them using `pip`:


## Results

The performance of both models is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The results are displayed in the notebook and the web app.
